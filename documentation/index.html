			<h3>Needs Analysis + User Stories</h3>
			<p>
				Needs analysis: We set out to understand how students would interact with Refract. A Needs Analysis helps us identify key problems that Refract might be able to resolve in a student/organization's day-to-day life. Through this process, we discovered 3
				key usability stages:
				<ul class="steps">
					<li>
						<h4>Resource Discovery:</h4> Simple sign on, create profile
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Collaborating:</h4> Post listings, Good cross-search interface, Contact
					</li>
					<li>
						<h4>Outputs:</h4> Work created and reviewed
					</li>
				</ul>
				User stories: We used this tool to describe the type of user we hoped to gain, what they would want and why. From this we discovered that our target users would be Columbia students and Chicago nonprofits.

			<h3>Personas</h3>
			<p>
				We used this technique to think through who our user would be and why they would be using Refract. We prepared personas for each of our perceived audiences including Columbia students, Faculty, and Chicago nonprofit organization representatives. Each
				one of these personas included plausible assumptions we could make about our users including their likes, dislikes, willingness to work with others, and their goals.

			<h3>Surveys</h3>
			<p>
				We created two comprehensive surveys to start collecting user insights. One survey to capture Organization insights and one survey to capture Student insights. We took a three-step process to analyze the feedback we received


			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="showroom">
			<ul class="steps">
				<li>
					<h3>Step 1:</h3> Analyzed student survey results We discovered that 92.1% of student that answered the survey felt as though they would benefit from working with nonprofit organizations in artistic medium.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Step 2:</h3> Interviewed students We followed up by interviewing 12 students and found that students feel most comfortable working with someone new when there is accountability/thoughtfulness worked into the project description. We decided to try and embody
					that feeling through Refract and from that came the idea of creating a timeline.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Step 3:</h3> Analyzed Organization survey results We discovered that organizations who worked with Columbia students in the past felt as though they were unreliable. To change that mindset we created a dual review system that allows both students and organizations
					to provide private feedback to Convergence on the work that was done.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Comparative Analysis + Content Audit</h3>
			<ul class="steps">
				<li>
					<h4>Comparative Analysis:</h4> It’s important not only to the team, but to Convergence, that Refract stand apart from other Columbia collaboration tools such as Handshake and Talent pool. To avoid any element duplications our research team dissected both Talent pool and Handshake
					element by element. From their log in screens to the way that they display content, we reviewed every single site interaction and were able to start designing our own sites interface and overall persona.

				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Content Audit:</h4> Once we were able to define exactly what we would be producing, we thought through the process a user would take on each page of Refract. The content audit helped us define exactly what we needed to start designing and when.

			<h3>Mood Board / Product Persona Research</h3>
			<p>
				If our brand was a person/thing it would be Nature and Light. It will have users feel welcomed and want to explore the site. The Light will help guide the user and understand how to function through the site. It’s very open, clean, and calming so the
				user can enjoy their time. Since it’s so open, users can meet new people and collaborate. Our design persona was created soon after we decided on the name Refract. We wanted the name to be more than just an interesting word, but a guiding light for
				the entire site. We created the Voice of Refract, the Visual Lexicon, (including color and typography), and the Brand Traits in order to keep our designers focused. </p>

			<h2 class="subtitle1">User Interface</h2>
			<p>
				This functionality and flow of a website is an essential part in maintaining a consistent user base. From the start of the project, we each had our own idea of how the site would function but it was through a steady iteration cycle that we conceived a
				system that brought a concise experience to our users.

			<h3>Storyboard</h3>
			<p>
				The first storyboards emerged when our team needed know what information to store in our database. We created storyboards walking through the onboarding process. With this exercise, we gained a base from which to begin development as well as a headway
				into the creation of our prototypes.

			<h3>Prototypes</h3>
			<p>
				Using proto.io, we built two prototypes in tandem to receive a larger scope of feedback from testers. The prototypes grew in two different directions. One more focused on the look and ui, the other more focused on capturing the complete functionality
				and flow of our project. The feedback we received impelled us to make changes to our skills organization, Content layout, onboarding process and project viewing. After testing the prototypes we moved forward with the results of our testing in mind.

			<h3>Wireframes</h3>
			<p>
				The wireframes created would come inform the final look and feel of the project. Using the testing from the prototypes, we designed several wireframes to use in our final designs of our network. This was done through a series of rapid prototyping on paper
				then creating concise designs in a small team to enhance our designs.

			<p>
				The look and feel of any given website has the potential to attract and repel it’s users. That’s why we strove to capture the essence of collaboration and present it in a creative manner. Refract was designed to embody opportunity to its users, and inspire
				them to create change.

			<h3>Style Tiles</h3>
			<p>
				With a name as bold as refract, we had to make the look of the website bold as well. Several members of the team each brought individual ideas of their refract, and during a grueling 5 meeting, we workshopped through the various ideas. The result was
				a bright eye turning color palette that users can help but notice, and a bold, black typeface that was as loud as our palette. It would be easy to get carried away with all the energy in the style, but we focused out colors in distinct areas to steer
				users in a natural flow through our website. Giving much of the space on our pages a clean, white finish.

			<h3>Voice (Copy)</h3>
			<p>
				The voice and copy of Refract was done only after careful consideration of various factors. Our users, students and organizations, the purpose of the network, What we want our users to achieve, Once we had these things in mind, we brainstormed words for
				our voice. Not just adjectives but verbs, and traits that we want to use in the tone. These sets of words is what we drew from when creating copy for Refract. The copy had to embody experience, intelligence, passion, professionalism and inspiration.
				A thorough script of every word that populates our system was then created. By the end, the professional yet inspiring voice works with the clean and bright style to attract users.
