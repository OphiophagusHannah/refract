<!-- User Interface
This functionality and flow of a website is an essential part in maintaining a consistent user base. From the start of the project, we each had our own idea of how the site would function but it was through a steady iteration cycle that we conceived a system that brought a concise experience to our users.

Storyboard
The first storyboards emerged when our team needed know what information to store in our database. We created storyboards walking through the onboarding process. With this exercise, we gained a base from which to begin development as well as a headway into the creation of our prototypes.

Prototypes
Using proto.io, we built two prototypes in tandem to receive a larger scope of feedback from testers. The prototypes grew in two different directions. One more focused on the look and ui, the other more focused on capturing the complete functionality and flow of our project. The feedback we received impelled us to make changes to our skills organization, Content layout, onboarding process and project viewing. After testing the prototypes we moved forward with the results of our testing in mind

Wireframes
The wireframes created would come inform the final look and feel of the project. Using the testing from the prototypes, we designed several wireframes to use in our final designs of our network. This was done through a series of rapid prototyping on paper then creating concise designs in a small team to enhance our designs.

Look & Feel
The look and feel of any given website has the potential to attract and repel it’s users. That’s why we strove to capture the essence of collaboration and present it in a creative manner. Refract was designed to embody opportunity to its users, and inspire them to create change.

Style Tiles
With a name as bold as refract, we had to make the look of the website bold as well. Several members of the team each brought individual ideas of their refract, and during a grueling 5 meeting, we workshopped through the various ideas. The result was a bright eye turning color palette that users can help but notice, and a bold, black typeface that was as loud as our palette. It would be easy to get carried away with all the energy in the style, but we focused out colors in distinct areas to steer users in a natural flow through our website. Giving much of the space on our pages a clean, white finish.

Voice/copy
The voice and copy of Refract was done only after careful consideration of various factors. Our users, students and organizations, the purpose of the network, What we want our users to achieve, Once we had these things in mind, we brainstormed words for our voice. Not just adjectives but verbs, and traits that we want to use in the tone. These sets of words is what we drew from when creating copy for Refract. The copy had to embody experience, intelligence, passion, professionalism and inspiration. A thorough script of every word that populates our system was then created. By the end, the professional yet inspiring voice works with the clean and bright style to attract users. -->

Comparative analysis + Content Audit- Mad
It’s important not only to the team, but to Convergence, that Refract stand apart from other Columbia collaboration tools such as Handshake and Talent pool. To avoid any element duplications our research team dissected both talent pool + handshake element by element. From their log in screens to the way that they display content, we dissected every single site interaction and were able to start designing our own sites interface + overall persona.

Mood Board/ product persona research -
If our brand was a person/thing it would be Nature and Light. It will have users feel welcomed and want to explore the site. The Light will help guide the user and understand how to function through the site. It’s very open, clean, and calming so the user can enjoy their time. Since it’s so open, users can meet new people and collaborate. Our design persona was created soon after we decided on the name Refract. We wanted the name to be more than just an interesting word, but a guiding light for the entire site. We created the Voice of Refract, the Visual Lexicon, (including color and typography), and the Brand Traits in order to keep our designers focused.
